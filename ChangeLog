Version 1.0.4 (released 05 Mar 2004)

	* Added support for SPICE kernels for spacecraft ephemerides.

	* Xplanet now works without freetype.  There will be no text
	annotation, but it will run instead of exit immediately.

Version 1.0.3 (released 06 Jan 2004)

	* Jupiter and Saturn are now drawn as oblate spheroids.

Version 1.0.2 (released 22 Dec 2003)

	* Added -interpolate_origin_file option so that origin_files may
	be used as ephemeris files.

	* Added -label_string option to set the first line of the label. 

	* Added the Lambert (Cylindrical Equal Area) projection.

	* The -geometry option now applies to the root window.  The area
	outside the image is black.

	* The format for the star map is different.  It is now Dec, RA,
	Mag to be consistent with marker and arc files, which have lat
	then lon.

	* -marker_file and -arc_file can now be used on the command line.
	Coordinates for these files are Declination and Right Ascension.
	Markers and arcs are plotted against the star field.

	* Fixed a text rendering bug where the text wasn't positioned
	properly.
	
	* Added -dynamic_origin option to read a file for the observer's
	position before each rendering.

	* Changed --disable-screensaver to --with-xscreensaver in
	configure script.
	
	* -origin and -range options can now be used together.

	* Added -save_desktop_file option for Windows and OS X.

	* Added twilight option in config file to adjust extent of
	terminator.

	* -localtime option wasn't right for most planets.

	* Added -ephemeris_file option.  This allows the use of JPL's
	DExxx files for super-duper accuracy.

	* Added pango support.  The workings of pango are still mysterious
	to me so there may be things that don't quite look right.  There
	are memory leaks inside the pango library, so using this option
	all of the time is not a good idea.
	
Version 1.0.1 (released 17 Mar 2003)

	* mapbounds is now supported as an option in the configuration
	file. 

	* Xplanet now works natively on Aqua, but is a little flaky; it
	sometimes fails to set the desktop and the default "Aqua Blue"
	shows up.  Reproducible bug reports are greatly appreciated!

	* The timer would cause an exit after one drawing on non-X11
	systems. 

	* Markers on the other planets were not drawn properly with the
	-projection option.

Version 1.0.0 (released 11 Mar 2003)

	* First public release.  See the NEWS file for changes from the
	previous version.
