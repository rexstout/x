Version 1.0.1 (released )

	* mapbounds is now supported as an option in the configuration
	file. 

	* Xplanet now works natively on Aqua, but is a little flaky; it
	sometimes fails to set the desktop and the default "Aqua Blue"
	shows up.  Reproducible bug reports are greatly appreciated!

	* The timer would cause an exit after one drawing on non-X11
	systems. 

	* Markers on the other planets were not drawn properly with the
	-projection option.


Version 1.0.0 (released 11 Mar 2003)

	* First public release.  See the NEWS file for changes from the
	previous version.
